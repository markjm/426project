# CBO-Simplifier
### Deprecated


## Goal
Encourage U.S. citizens to remain vigilant of the governmental budget by presenting CBO data in a user-friendly manner.

## About
A simple web app that scrapes budget information for each bill introduced on cbo.gov, and presents a simple summary and cost analyis.

## Current Issues
As individual bills are presented differently, scraping is not always perfect. We have allowed users to edit misinformation, but have no security measure in place to ensure accuracy.
